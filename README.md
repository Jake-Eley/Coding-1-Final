# Coding-1-Final
This is a place where you can learn a little bit about me and what I enjoy doing. Some of my favorite hobbies are golfing, fishing, and spending time with my friends. I like being outdoors, trying new things, and having fun with the people around me. I enjoy relaxing weekends, going on trips, and making memories with people I care about. After high school, I plan to continue learning and find a career that fits my interests. I’m still deciding what I want to do, but I’m excited for the future and the opportunities that lie ahead.
